### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with experience in Vue.js, Node.js, and Nuxt. 
My main areas of interest include developing web applications using these tools. 

I'm also a maintainer of the Flowbite-Vue project, contributing to the development of this amazing component library for Vue.js.
Additionally, I help translate various projects into Russian.
I believe in making technology accessible to the Russian-speaking developer community, and I'm happy to contribute to this field.
